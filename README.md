# EkimetricsApply

Welcome in my apply project! This is a work realized by [Pierre-Etienne Soury](http://pesoury.xyz)

## Objectives

The goal is to gather posts and comments from [ProducHunt](https://www.producthunt.com/), and to display the number of comments' evolution on graphs, with d3.js and Angular.

This is a test of my ability to use Angular, which I was familiar with, and to utilize new skills, since I didn't know d3.js at all.
It's also a way to make a fun project and give back a - hopefully - working prototype.

## Realization

### Beginning

I had 2 weeks to complete this project.
